| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sdkwork-terminal-flutter-mobile | flutter-mobile | yes | SDKWork Terminal Mobile flutter-mobile application root. | `sdkwork-terminal-flutter-mobile/` |
| sdkwork-terminal-h5 | h5 | yes | SDKWork Terminal H5 h5 application root. | `sdkwork-terminal-h5/` |
| sdkwork-terminal-pc | pc | yes | SDKWork Terminal pc application root. | [README](sdkwork-terminal-pc/README.md) |
